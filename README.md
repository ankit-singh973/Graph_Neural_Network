# Graph_Neural_Network

This repository is dedicated to my exploration and practice of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Graph Neural Networks are powerful models for learning from graph-structured data, and this repository serves as a collection of my implementations, experiments, and resources related to GNNs.

Happy coding and happy graph learning!
